## optimSolverInfoExt
#### 1. "extInfo_perSolver.r" 
This file mainly has two functions:
(a). To extract information from several LP/MIP solvers (i.e., cplex, cbc, clp, glpk, lpsolve). The output would be a organized dataframe.
(b). To plot the results across solvers with interactive graphs.

#### 2. "getInfo_testEngine.r"
This file is used to extract information from output of MIPLIB2010 test engine. Input files include ".res" and ".out" files generated by the test engine itself.
